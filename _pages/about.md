Welcome to Cong’s homepage
======
I’m a second year Ph.D. student at the Department of statistics of [University of Georgia](https://www.stat.uga.edu). My advisor is Prof. [Yuan Ke](https://yuan-ke.github.io). Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student in [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://math.ustc.edu.cn/ENGLISH/list.htm).
